# College Fantasy Football Predictor
The goal of this application is to provide a one stop shop for all your college football fantasy needs. For those of you who don't even know what I'm talking about, please see this website - http://games.espn.go.com/college-football-challenge/2014/en/

I'm what some may call a fanatic when it comes to this game. For a while now, I've chosen players based on certain inputs and I'm hoping with this application that those inputs can be quantified to provide the ultimate predictor each week for choosing players.

This application is written in Python and Django
